im downtown waiting for a bus and i see my neighbors  theyre mexicans actually a large family heres the mother and a couple of daughters we chat and some others in the family come along husband i guess and other sons  daughters they were just in the vicinity and are going to give the wife et al a lift home i seem to be excluded which i think is pretty tacky they walk along to where the car is and after a hesitation i tag along trying to chat with the younger son whos somewhat retarded and who i have previously had a sort of amiable relationship with hes dressed up in a suit rather unusual and hes not interested in talking to me  in fact we stop for a bit and as were facing each other i can see hes looking at me with real hostility very strange im disconcerted and figure i better just go on off my merry way elsewhere on the street further up im walking along with my purse firmly clamped under my arm  i feel a tug on it and turn around to see whats going on a sleazylooking little man in an illfitting suit has hold of it  he thought he could just snatch it apparently and since i have it firmly he didnt get it he looks at me menacingly as if id better let go of the thing or id be sorry and i pull back on it again very indignant neither of us makes a sound im not anxious to cause a scene if hell just let go maybe hell think twice about pursesnatching again he apparently just wants me to be intimidated into letting him have it because he could hurt me  indeed he starts to reach into his jacket for something making an expression thats supposed to be warning me  i guess hes got a gun or a knife but im not going for it not yet anyway theres lots of people around he could hardly get away with it  though at the same time i realize he probably could the way things are today im worried about that sort of thing still i yank on my purse before he can reach whatever it is and get it free i hustle on ahead it goes through my mind that i ought to hold my purse further forward to make it harder for somebody to grab from behind then i picture myself always carrying my purse  clutched tightly to my chest like im paranoid then i picture everybody all the people going up and down the street carrying their stuff like that all holding on for dear life ludicrous really oh well i stop to tell a policeman whos standing a bit further up the street what happened but hes not interested i go on to this hotelapartment house that im  in it looks like a lot of places ive seen in england  long hallways oldlooking but solid very well kept plain dark wood stairrails etc this man runs it he has a bit of jerry haynes and walter pidgeon in him and were trying to hide elvis presley im a sort of companion although there are some others involved in this effort and weve come to this man as a contact who will help hide elvis and get him away the man is rather on the suspicious side himself though  rather odd a dapper little guy with a silly little mustache cryptic secretive im not comfortable with him i meet them in our room and put my things down coat over the back of the couch etc and we go down the hall a few yards up a few steps and around a corner to another room the man leaves were to wait i think about my purse again after a few minutes realizing its just sitting on the back of the couch very noticeable and we didnt shut the door  theres nobody about the place might be deserted except for us but im worried i know i shouldnt leave elvis alone but i get antsy and after a few more minutes i decide itll be okay to just dash back to the room and fix it i look all down the hall  theres nobody to be seen no sounds  and i go my purse is there but as i pick it up it seems to feel different lighter like somethings missing i check briefly but it seems okay  checkbooks there that would be the biggest thing dont know maybe its lighter because i had something in it earlier that usually isnt oh well i take it back with me to the other room elvis isnt there uhoh i look all over for him  this is a kind of suite it has a kitchen and living area  an efficiency apartment no elvis the man comes back some other people too one of whom is a girlfriend of mine we discuss the matter and divide up somebody goes out the man gets on the phone its also getting on for dinnertime and were cooking something i figure we want some cinnamon for this dish weve got going and i think of a plant thats in the back of the room near the window it has little leaves on it that either are cinnamon or taste like it and i start to pick some off i look out the window casually and am surprised to see a dog lying on the grass whats in back of this  is mostly trees a little bit of yard and a little railroad track its dark and what light there is is coming from here through the window this dog looks funny and i suddenly see blood on its head and i realize its been hit  it looks dead yuck but as i watch it moves  it was just hurt it lifts its head up and shifts around and i now realize its not even a dog  i guess  maybe it is but its beginning to look like an elephant thats very weird im getting very confused watching it i realize that if its an elephant it must be a baby if i mistook it for a dog geez i suppose id better tell somebody about this but im not sure im not hallucinating either wow i go back into the room and mean to give the leaves to my friend for the pot but before i do she shows me she found some old cinnamon somewhere and shes all ready to use that i dont mention my leaves though i feel rather shot down  its amazing how little i feel as if i were a little kid whod been slighted by her parents so i just poopoo myself and carry on we go into the dining room this place has gotten bigger you see and were talking theres a dining table lengthwise in the room a window at the end with filmy drapes and just the daylight through them so the rooms in shadow theres a chair or two away from the table standing between us having just come in the door and the space next to the table on the other side  is a very large papiermache black bird i dont know what its for  though maybe its something to do with an upcoming party the mans having  but i look at it briefly its rather neat it moves and at first im surprised but realize its probably just tipped over vibrated off balance but then it moves again and im sure its done it on purpose i say stop that as if its alive thinking how silly i sound and remark to my girlfriend that im sure i saw it move i go around the chair to get in front of it as its moved toward the table and i squat down facing it when i do i realize its actually a cat not a bird how could i have mistaken it for a bird strange and its very cunning this thing it doesnt quite look like papiermache any more its got fur  and i notice two extra eyes looking at me hidden in the black fur above the fake eyes i stare for a minute then realize what im seeing  by george its elvis this is a disguise i tell my girlfriend to come see and at first she doesnt either  this is really good i explain to her what this is and first she says oh pshaw something like that but then she sees too and is also dumbfounded there are two blue eyes peeping through that fur i dont know how he got in this outfit that fast but it sure is a good way to hide i suspect that the man has something to do with this but i dont know,nightmare,nightmare,0,-5.4239593,41.22122,0.006661643,0.014761839,0.971907212,0.006669307

im standing in front of a pantry as opposed to the kind you walk into i think i meantsmall closet in the kitchen in a small house the cat food is supposed to be at the bottom on the floor of this pantry in a rubber container kinda like the cat litter whats here at the moment is theres cat food scattered on the floor where its been left as a mess but dry cat food is stacked if you will  really  on the right side next to the wall as though you might imagine there would be a dispenser or something  but the dispenser isnt there any more and its in the same position and im scooping up the bits just to neaten things up and i also notice some yellow liquid on the floor  and i check it out im assuming that its cat pee and im assuming that alleycat did it and im taken aback when i check it out touch it it turns out to be oily and it doesnt smell and what it turns out to be is dripped oil from one of the bottles on a lower shelf on the floor things are generally kind of messy here now the reason this is unusual is that in the other room bettye is talking to a guy that has just cleaned this place hes kind of on the dark and swarthy side kind of stocky burly he has just taken over from the guy who was doing it before and his price is in question it was kind of like georges thing he had a price raised the price somebody else came in and lowered the price it was like  to  and  and now this guy wants  and bettye is hesitant about it  shes not wanting to give him  and theres something in it about she doesnt actually have it  i mean she does have it but were kind of stretching around here and hes explaining to her you know how things are and that he needed the extra  and hes sort of implying that it was more work here or something but then in fact what im seeing is that hes not doing as good a job theres like what im seeing in this pantry and elsewhere im in the pantry overhearing this feeling kinda guilty because of the cat food and stuff thinking that its my fault and that i ought to be taking part you know kicking in for the money  or more anyway  im not actually sure how we distribute it bettye is kind of the head of the household and in some respects shes running this particular thing i kind of think bettye is a substitute too and where we are is something on the order of a college neighborhood and i have just previously been in  a scene in a place thats something like a dorm only its not in a building its like a cabin morelike arrangement where youre on the ground floor anyway and have a porch and im outside on the porch trying to communicate with my mother through one of those wooden necklacethings that i got from the library store the philippine things we discovered that we could talk to each other over them and i may be looking at this place wanting to rent it  maybe even for both of us  but i go out on the porch and i seem to be facing a big group of buildings theyre kind of like fair park or a college  the university just crossed my mind too  and the atmosphere is interfering or something i speak to her once and we make connection and then im talking and i realize that shes not answering back and then i cant hear the same sound that i had and i try to get her back and its not working theres a guy here present and i dont know what his involvement is right now but hes part of this hes a young nicelooking guy tall dressed casually  there was also another communication problem earlier i kept trying to call this other elsas offices extension i think it was my mother on the office phones  theres even a switchboard here of some description and i keep getting a wrong number i havent looked it up to verify what it is and i keep being absolutely sure ive got it and i call get the wrong number hang up immediately and the person on the other end of the line is very angry or somewhat angry anyhow  and the last time even starts to threaten that shes going to call somebody to investigate she names a party  not the police and not the telephone company i dont think but in any case im certainly alarmed about this  not that logically she can actually trace a call that was like that when all it is is just a brief connection and then hanging up  so i dont know what thats about,happy,happy,1,-5.274149,10.117772,0.877921087,0.06573642,0.022552704,0.033789789

im with some other people  friends im not sure who but they were like mt maybe even my brother and even don and lauren or somebody and we were going to look at a house this house was on a residential street that had some very nice large houses on it we were looking for a house that we might want to rent and we first went past it to the end of the street and we looked at the numbers and went back to it the houses at the end of the street were extremely nice and looked very expensive indeed and when we backed up a bit to go back to the house we wanted it seemed to be at least something less formal and maybe more likely but still an awfully nice house we were surprised that the person we were thinking of renting it from lived there because it was somebody more or less our age like us that wouldnt necessarily be able to afford a big house like that so we went up to the door and knocked and looked at the outside the person that answered was female and she let us in and said shed show us around nice and friendly and what we saw on the inside is not at all what we expected there was this enormous room broken up into areas and it had another level to it as though it were a sunken living room it was very open  there wasnt a whole lot of furniture there were people around and it looked very reminiscent of a hippie pad from the early s or s or more like a commune where a lot of people were living in the same place and just sort of having a good time and not just being roommates or residents or something like that and there seemed to be people having a good time around the girl that was with us just took us on through into the livingroom sort of area and straight across to a door that led into a small sort of shed really that youre meant to go through and you go outside from before we got there i was looking outside through a plate glass window on the right and saw a kind of little patio or garden sort of thing it wasnt real small it had bushes and stuff in it and there was a cat or two sitting out there something happened about the cat but i dont quite remember  it was large and black  and it kinda did something and left then we went into the shed and i was bringing up the rear everybody went back out again but i was interested in something that was hanging in the shed it was kind of like a potting shed although they had been stuck  certain things as well as plants  it was maybe kind of a greenhouse i guess or something in between i took whatever it was off the wall and went outside with it to have a better look at it it seems to me that it was like terracotta and i dont remember what it was after id looked at it and nobody else was  i took it back in and hung it back up on the wall again next i am on trial for something that i do not know exactly but it surely would have had to do with something like embezzlement what they were questioning was how i had so much money to spend why i had such nice things there were a whole lot of people there it was more like an auditorium than a courtroom  there were people up on the sides like bleachers or something and the light in the courtroom was very bright the prosecutor was very strong and powerful he wasnt entirely angry  of course he wasnt supposed to be angry but he was real determined that i should be  examined as thoroughly as possible in case i had done this  he would ask how i could afford to buy  like clothes or something how i could afford to have such nice things on my salary during the course of this trial they had called for a physical examination of me like an operation even  they wanted to make cuts in my body to examine something  not going all the way inside to the organs and so forth but kinda superficial cuts where you cut the skin in long straight lines down the arms and down the torso maybe something to do with bacteria or something i dont know i was real concerned about that but i was not real concerned about the trial in general there was a place in the back of the courtroom  it was rather more like a dressing room and i had of course my lawyer and some other people helping me out  i guess they would be like people on my lawyers staff or something  an older woman blonde professionaltype woman my lawyer was a man in a suit you know your basic sort of lawyer certainly not a kid but your basic yuppie professional and they were like attending on me like i was  oh dear somebody like a tv star or something  i would be in the back getting dressed getting my hair done stuff like that it wasnt very luxurious but it was certainly not what you would expect of being in a courtroom in fact i wasnt even in the courtroom  i wasnt even paying attention to how the trial was going except for the sound of the prosecutors voice he was quite loud and determined  making a show for the audience  and most of em were my friends and they didnt want to see me get into trouble they were interested certainly but he was definitely going to have to prove what he alleged and all of these questions seemed to me to be real obviously geared to getting me into trouble because everything he was asking could be answered very simply and he wasnt listening to what  well it wasnt that he wasnt listening to what i had to say because i wasnt there for him to hear but i was the one who could clear it up in the first place and until he got me on the stand where i could tell him these things it seemed like there wasnt much point in him even asking nobody else could tell him that i wouldnt buy anything very expensive unless it was on sale and i charge things and pay them out and sometimes people take me to lunch or something or i may buy myself meals and not get my hair cut things like that i certainly havent stolen anything and sometimes i do think i spend more than i need to  or well not more than i need to but more than i can afford to but thats my problem its certainly not anybody elses money and i dont know why i should be on trial for it but this physical examination thing concerned me quite a lot theres kind of a conflict here i have the impression that i have already had this examination and it didnt really work the way they thought it was going to but i think that isnt logical because that wouldnt have happened and there wouldnt have been any point in me being concerned about it further but i was  i was concerned about having it done correctly and fascinated with the procedure itself and so there werent actually any cuts on my body its as though they had tried to and it wouldnt do it so i was interested in that and i just decided id do it myself i got something to cut with  you see im not in the courtroom at the moment and whoever has been with me in the dressing room area  what i mean by that by the way is that its back off of the courtroom assuredly but its not closed off from it  theres a place where you can go like to change clothes but its just a back room open to the courtroom all the way in the back where nobody can turn around and look at you or nobodys doing it theyre not  or their attention is out in the middle of the court  anyway so whoever has been with me back there has gone away so im alone and i got something like a razor blade and started to make these cuts myself it surely would be awkward if you did that  lying down and trying to even make the sort of cut im talking about with one arm without looking at it but its as though i wasnt doing it that way its as though i was doing it from outside my body and was a little bit ragged and awkward at it at first but eventually i got the hang of it and  this is how it seemed awkward to me as though i was doing it from right over my body and  just like you would a doll you know  straight down and i discovered that it was awkward to do  the righthand side of my body  which seems to be the lefthand side from the position im actually cutting in so what i needed to do is to move around so i moved down to where i was really facing the side of my body to do that this is all very slow and awkward but there wasnt any blood or anything well i did that and i dont know anything more about it  it obviously didnt hurt particularly i know i kept expecting it to  i kept expecting it to feel at least you know like it does when you cut yourself so i was a little bit surprised that it didnt bleed but i wasnt worried about there being any real damage or anything because i knew i would heal up and quite sure that i knew id heal up without scars too just didnt seem that big a deal but now i felt like i had done it for them that they would be happy now it was like i have accomplished whatever it was they wanted me to do for them,nightmare,nightmare,0,-7.337591,41.09793,0.006611644,0.017981381,0.968336755,0.00707022

im coming up to a sort of rocky ledge with a low  wall  all around theres sky huge and beautiful theres a mountain range in the distance the colors are all yellowish and theres a sort of earlymorning feel its not warm but its not real cold either somehow i know this either is tibet or were coming to it down beneath the wall are a couple of flowers growing theyre very sturdy thickleafed the kind of petals that start out green first and shaped something like hyacinths i think ill eat one but i see it isnt fully developed yet theres another though with a wider shape to it and quite thick  rather than made up of lightweight petals and i pull that and take bites of it as i do  i find that buried in it is a small saucerlike bit of pottery standard whiteglazed with a flower pattern round the edge much like diner dishes  i pull it out and see that its the foot of a sort of vase or stemmed dish wed found around here shortly before and wed wondered where the foot was it seems that the flower just grew around it we go on soon we get to civilization of a sort were in a stairwell of a building i can tell is massive and the scene is mostly dark as if it were night and we were seeing outside through windows but were not  on the left  is a huge wall and it shows a magnificent scene although right now i cant remember what of or even what it looked like  it may have even been an outdoor landscape as if there were a window there i halfway think the wall in front on the stairwell was indeed a window but im not sure to the right is an open door into a lighted room and people  not in large numbers  keep moving up and down the stairs and into and out of the room theyre all orientals these people dressed in native clothes the long coats the hats with round standup brims the slipper shoes im aware that this place is equivalent in some respects to a shopping mall  of course plain and simple it is one it has lots of vendors selling things that people want and need all under one roof but theres some fundamental difference in it too these people are taking the thing more seriously for one thing and it isnt set up intentionally for fun  though there are some neat things about it the lefthand wall for instance at first i thought i was looking at  really magnificent and elaborate but now something has shifted  either its done this on purpose or my viewpoint has changed but i see now that the whole thing is painted an illusion a bloody good illusion but nevertheless not what i thought it was now that i know that it bothers me  the whole situation bothers me im not sure what to do next at the same time whats occupying my mind is the observation of this shoppingmall business the idea of the mall is sort of new to us here but when you think about it theres nothing unusual about it except that we started building malls in places where there were already plenty of stores to be found elsewhere stores are still grouped collectively for the convenience of the shoppers but they have to come from farther away and do more business at a time thats why there were fairs and street markets it wouldnt be any sillier to build a regular mall in tibet than in texas for heavens sake if people want to buy things why wouldnt they do it in a mall just as easily as from rickety booths on the street im on a city bus with several people from yoga class  i guess weve just left a class  including george and maybe cynthia ive got my purse and something else with me which i stow on the seat this is another funny bus  has its seats placed differently from regular buses and its up high like the outoftowncoaches were all in a pretty fun mood and we bowl along through a pretty part of town with big trees and nice streets older houses and occasional stores and offices at one point the bus is diverted by road works from its regular route and we turn to the left then because of the diversion we have to drive through a building  actually its a lot like the central area pharmacy except its got a garage attached theres  sections to it you can pull in the front or the back  the front is a bit more finished with matching red brick to the store  you can enter the store from there the back is different with painted walls a little more garagelike the bus stops in the front its going to wait there to catch up to its schedule and we all pile out of it to stretch our legs and look around this is a place we know anyway but its neat theres a sort of art exhibit in the back section various things stuck up on the wall as if a childrens school class had done them sue s is here  and shes looking at them with us and tree is here too  this place is only a short distance from where i live  on the street in back matter of fact  and hes been exploring down here i guess hes come in the back door  and i pick him up and show him to the people actually im surprised hes letting me do that and im keeping a good strong grip because hes beginning to get twitchy  but sue and some others say oh what a pretty kitty and i make up my mind to just go on home with him from here since were so close without waiting for the bus i have to go back in to get my stuff though and i suppose i put tree down because he wasnt with me for the next part i climb up and go to get my purse and things but while im here the bus starts to move i guess it must have been left in gear or something because it starts going right on out and across the street  and carries on for a couple of blocks it stops eventually because it runs up against something i guess but its a bit precarious i can see that the street is going a bit downhill and if it starts to roll again itll be hard to stop i get out very carefully and go around to the front thinking i might push it backward off of the incline if i can  but its just barely starting to move again and i give it a push but no go  oh dear i leap out of the way and remember i still havent got my things so i jump back on the bus gathers momentum and rolls onward down a street and around a curve and finally comes to rest somewhere no particular damage done i am joined now by a little guy in a rather exotic outfit  hes not quite midgetsized but definitely well below average   we discuss the situation which is more involved than it looks  we need to contact somebody for help we cant handle this bus on our own  we know theres normally a crew of  men to run it and we cant just leave it where it is and go  we poke around some and find the radio to call the centralwhatever with and send a message to send help that done we banter around some more  this all seems like a rather fun adventure  and sort of get cozy he proposes having sex right there in the cabin and i think it sounds like something of a lark and say yes  ive never had sex with an elf before for sure and it might be very different who knows weve got nothing better to do till the rescue party gets here although we dont know when thatll be actually a fair amount of time has passed already suddenly as he moves over me lying on the floor he gets bigger  much bigger he sort of stretches out till he looms over me and i dont like it i say so and next he reaches beyond me over my head to a shelf where hes put something to be handy its a kind of facemask only its made of beads  and it fits over his chin loosely like a beard the look on his face has gone very serious the way you do when the playful part of sex gives way to the other feelings at that moment the crew sent out from the central office arrives we break apart in a hurry as you might imagine and explain who we are and what happened there are  men and a woman they look very cold and matteroffact but ask us to help  i go downstairs  toward the front of the place were in  you might call it a cockpit  it no longer looks like a bus theres a wall behind very shiplike  there are stairs or a ladder to the next level i hadnt even realized this was here theres a bathroom down here good i need one and go across the room towards it but a man goes into it before me so i have to wait now im confused who is this guy and how did he get here before me is he one of the tree that just arrived and got here by another stair or has he been down here the whole time if so why didnt he say anything is he hiding oh well ill just

im at a place that resembles the yoga studio this is a house fairly big and long  with various doors down the side im with some other people and fred whos got to feed the pets for the owners of the house theyre on vacation and hes gone on in its rather dark like a very dark day or dusk but thats normal the house may be old or not but its kind of clumsylooking not exactly ramshackle but tired neglected something like that and thats normal too some men show up looking for the residents or at least the wife and we tell them theyre not there they ask something we cant answer either where theyve gone or can they  the men  come into the house for some reason and we  say we can ask fred about it hes the only one who knows anything so we go down to the door where the kitchen is i thought it was one in particular and then realized it was the next one instead so i open that one and heres fred behind the refrigerator door which opens across the space of the outside door its also up a step so all i see of fred is the top of his head i start to ask him our question but he waves me away with his arm  i start again but and he does it again very vehemently so i just shrug and say okay and close the door i assume that maybe the dogs are very touchy and might get vicious if theres some interruption or somethings going on in there that he shouldnt be distracted from the door is metal and rather flimsy  it doesnt close very well and i fiddle with it for a bit next scene this is directly connected but im pretty sure doesnt happen in the same place theres this girl whos staying in this apartment thats part of highrise combination officeresidentialshopping conglomeration shes young blonde short hair nicelooking  i dont know if she lives here or is staying with a friend but shes alone for now she goes down the hall to this copy office a kind of selfserve place that also has files in it and a couple of secretarial types who work at desks our girl is looking for a file in some sort of drawer  the files are left of the door and theres a table in the center of this end of the room so to look in the lower files youre rather crowded between it and the table one of the secretaries comes over to the same area and in order to get where she wants she has to reach around the girl this is pretty close in and the girl is very uncomfortable she gets up as soon as she can back in the apartment some men come in theyre all wearing suits and seem a bit on the tough side and apparently this is some sort of a kidnapping the leader forces the girl to tie up the other guys  and then he ties her up and then himself now you cant actually tie yourself up too well of course and this is rather perfunctory but then he can still do the next thing which is to set the place on fire actually there is a fire but the whole place doesnt burn up  theres a lot of smoke and its very murky but the fire goes out it appears this is intentional its something akin to a suicide pact but more into s  m later presumably the previous episode is past shes come back to the copy room again but this time shes nervous looking very uptight about something she stands for a bit on the other side of the table as if she were waiting for something then she goes to the file again and the same thing happens  the secretary comes over and practically has her arms around our girl to get at some files this time she freaks out though and fights back struggling kicking screaming the secretary tries to subdue her which makes it worse and they knock around some more and then the girl gets away she runs down the hall which is where i see her i start to chase her  theres a reason for this im some sort of law enforcement  and she gets away down the turns shes frantic  pretty mussed and her knees are all scratched up pantyhose  all torn shes bleeding a bit so shes quite noticeable weve come out into this very large mall multilevel lots of people about bright lights she runs to an escalator in the middle and takes off down it we  follow and i hesitate for a second at the top seeing that theres not many people up here but its crowded at the bottom  the escalator is very wide  and im afraid im not surefooted enough to run down this thing but i think ive got on good running shoes and i can do this so off we go at top speed taking  or  steps at a time and down toward the bottom i realize that its not as crowded as it had looked from the top theres enough room we dash on across the floor after her to a door that leads to the underground parking garage its a garage all right theres cars here but boy is it grungy were up a bit you go down a halfflight of concrete steps to the parking floor everything here is covered with grime and to our left a car is being picked up by a filthy tow truck  it looks like theyve been working on it and have had to give up so theyre towing it the mechanics are all black dressed in sweaty greasy darkblue shortsleeved mechanic shirts and pants all their stuff has pounds of that thick black grease mixed with dirt on it that you could scrape off like mud  we dash down the stairs following the girl around the center rows of cars to the left then right again to the back wall where theres a concrete walk up some steps with a rail and it turns around to more steps descending into a pit theres a door down there and shes making for that  i gather that this is the passage to the gangs secret hideout how theyve been getting to places they break into the girl pauses on the steps looks up at us still on the walkway and shes wilder than ever shes got dark circles around her eyes like a s dracula movie and a maniacal grin she flings some taunt at us like well be back  well get you or youll get yours youll see something like

im married to somebody living in a house with kids   fairly ordinary small house forties fifties maybe not in great repair i think theres maybe one of the kids home otherwise just me right now im straightening some things up ive got some old junk out to clean up or throw out and its cold in here so i go look at the thermostat its on the wall next to a table like mine really is and its coming apart its not even easy to read  parts of it are hanging down i fiddle with it some and think maybe its gone for good i think i can read the temperature on it and its set okay but is it really working im not sure i can read what it really is while im over there i knock a box of hair combs off the table onto the floor and one of them breaks i see it between the table and the wall and the ornaments came off and are lying face down  one of them as i pick it up looks like a dead spider and i drop it then i reach for another bit thats definitely a feather and i realize that it was only a butterfly made of feathers so i pick that up and the comb and the rest of em  theyre all that plastic tortoiseshell stuff im also taking some old bits of things with gunk all over them out of a box to unmuck and these things ive got now are covered with wax like somebody burned candles in them i can pull it all out at once  turns out theyre some kind of levellers for furniture we can maybe use them ive also got quite a lump of waxgunk here kind of interesting while im near it i see a shape scurrying along the wall i just know its a rat or something equally nasty i throw the lump of gunk at it  and i may have hit it but didnt do it any damage  it scurries further to an open door that leads into the attic so thats where it came from its gone out of sight but reappears with a baby in its mouth now i can see its not a rat but a possum however in the dream it really didnt look like one it looked more like a prairie dog  i just called it a possum not so dangerous but i still dont want it running around my house especially not depositing babies it freezes when it sees me and i clap and shout to scare it it jumps and jostles the opposite door which leads into one of the boys rooms this is no great help but i dont know what else to do right now in fact people are starting to come in now  my husbands home several friends are coming for dinner kids home from school im feeling up now this is fun cares are on the back burner im chatting with a girlfriend in the kitchen  small kitchen small house but were comfortable my husband is nearby telling stories and jokes im feeling very affectionate toward him but we do have our differences hes saying something about me that he thinks is funny about me being incompetent or something and i think its not only untrue but offensive i look over to him and say im what and he looks like hehheh isnt she cute i go over and face him and he says i was only making a joke and i get fed up and decide to leave im tired of this kind of thing it happens too much and im just not going to stand for it maybe ill leave for good  right now i just believe ill go out and have a good time  find a friend have a drink do my own thing by coincidence a woman i know is just passing and i hitch a ride with her shes on her way somewhere but doesnt mind dropping me off  maybe barbara will be home and ill stay there or linda while were driving along we chat and im still trying hard to remember the name of the blonde actress who used to do everything on tv in the s i keep coming up with madelyn rhue but thats wrong and another name but the right one wont come we drive around a building that has a few shops in it on the street the corner one has a stucco front and a window above the main window and the door and theres what i take to be a plaster ornament above the main window its a cat a purple and white one  not dark purple or quite lavender but noticeable when you look only its stuck on sideways as if the wall was the cats floor however now i can see the cat is real a live breathing cat sitting casually on the wall like nothing was unusual it moves it licks its paw just like normal i strain out the car to peer at it and call to my friend youve got to see this so she looks and we dont know what to make of it and we go on we come to a sort of tiny sadlooking laundromat next to a matching sortof  and stop next to an open vehicle with two men in it one of them gets out and as he passes my side he casually reaches in and lifts out a little round purse by its shoulder strap which has been lying on the dashboard and its easily reached by the very front of the window because the windows been broken out im startled and i say wait that purse put that back  and my friend says what and i ask her if that isnt her purse  and tell her what he did hes gone on into the laundromat and i get out and start after him and point at the car and say something to the other man  and he starts to back the car out while the first one runs out and down the street im verbally calling out descriptions of them and the car  its a lot like a vw thing or some form of jeep but i cant see what for all the numbers painted on the back im not even sure i can remember the license  for all the other stuff i run behind and grab onto the back to get a closer look then jump off we go into the  thing where theyve seen all this and were going to call the police but suddenly the first guy   comes bursting into the place and now hes got a gun a revolver im pretty shaken but i get down behind a table and pull it up in front of me he definitely wants to shoot me thats what hes come back for hes real mad i say do you really mean to kill me just for a little purse that probably didnt have anything in it anyway im getting a real sober feeling that im about to

im married to somebody living in a house with kids   fairly ordinary small house forties fifties maybe not in great repair i think theres maybe one of the kids home otherwise just me right now im straightening some things up ive got some old junk out to clean up or throw out and its cold in here so i go look at the thermostat its on the wall next to a table like mine really is and its coming apart its not even easy to read  parts of it are hanging down i fiddle with it some and think maybe its gone for good i think i can read the temperature on it and its set okay but is it really working im not sure i can read what it really is while im over there i knock a box of hair combs off the table onto the floor and one of them breaks i see it between the table and the wall and the ornaments came off and are lying face down  one of them as i pick it up looks like a dead spider and i drop it then i reach for another bit thats definitely a feather and i realize that it was only a butterfly made of feathers so i pick that up and the comb and the rest of em  theyre all that plastic tortoiseshell stuff im also taking some old bits of things with gunk all over them out of a box to unmuck and these things ive got now are covered with wax like somebody burned candles in them i can pull it all out at once  turns out theyre some kind of levellers for furniture we can maybe use them ive also got quite a lump of waxgunk here kind of interesting while im near it i see a shape scurrying along the wall i just know its a rat or something equally nasty i throw the lump of gunk at it  and i may have hit it but didnt do it any damage  it scurries further to an open door that leads into the attic so thats where it came from its gone out of sight but reappears with a baby in its mouth now i can see its not a rat but a possum however in the dream it really didnt look like one it looked more like a prairie dog  i just called it a possum not so dangerous but i still dont want it running around my house especially not depositing babies it freezes when it sees me and i clap and shout to scare it it jumps and jostles the opposite door which leads into one of the boys rooms this is no great help but i dont know what else to do right now in fact people are starting to come in now  my husbands home several friends are coming for dinner kids home from school im feeling up now this is fun cares are on the back burner im chatting with a girlfriend in the kitchen  small kitchen small house but were comfortable my husband is nearby telling stories and jokes im feeling very affectionate toward him but we do have our differences hes saying something about me that he thinks is funny about me being incompetent or something and i think its not only untrue but offensive i look over to him and say im what and he looks like hehheh isnt she cute i go over and face him and he says i was only making a joke and i get fed up and decide to leave im tired of this kind of thing it happens too much and im just not going to stand for it maybe ill leave for good  right now i just believe ill go out and have a good time  find a friend have a drink do my own thing by coincidence a woman i know is just passing and i hitch a ride with her shes on her way somewhere but doesnt mind dropping me off  maybe barbara will be home and ill stay there or linda while were driving along we chat and im still trying hard to remember the name of the blonde actress who used to do everything on tv in the s i keep coming up with madelyn rhue but thats wrong and another name but the right one wont come we drive around a building that has a few shops in it on the street the corner one has a stucco front and a window above the main window and the door and theres what i take to be a plaster ornament above the main window its a cat a purple and white one  not dark purple or quite lavender but noticeable when you look only its stuck on sideways as if the wall was the cats floor however now i can see the cat is real a live breathing cat sitting casually on the wall like nothing was unusual it moves it licks its paw just like normal i strain out the car to peer at it and call to my friend youve got to see this so she looks and we dont know what to make of it and we go on we come to a sort of tiny sadlooking laundromat next to a matching sortof  and stop next to an open vehicle with two men in it one of them gets out and as he passes my side he casually reaches in and lifts out a little round purse by its shoulder strap which has been lying on the dashboard and its easily reached by the very front of the window because the windows been broken out im startled and i say wait that purse put that back  and my friend says what and i ask her if that isnt her purse  and tell her what he did hes gone on into the laundromat and i get out and start after him and point at the car and say something to the other man  and he starts to back the car out while the first one runs out and down the street im verbally calling out descriptions of them and the car  its a lot like a vw thing or some form of jeep but i cant see what for all the numbers painted on the back im not even sure i can remember the license  for all the other stuff i run behind and grab onto the back to get a closer look then jump off we go into the  thing where theyve seen all this and were going to call the police but suddenly the first guy   comes bursting into the place and now hes got a gun a revolver im pretty shaken but i get down behind a table and pull it up in front of me he definitely wants to shoot me thats what hes come back for hes real mad i say do you really mean to kill me just for a little purse that probably didnt have anything in it anyway im getting a real sober feeling that im about to

i am some sort of clerk perhaps a messenger  and i have files or some kind of papers to take to bob costas who is some kind of elected official he is in some kind of house or building some litttle distance away from where i am its a very nice old building  the way youd like old buildings or offices to be  has that dark wood long hallways heavy doors molding all that i go through on the first floor  i know people in here  and i know bob too not very well especially  certainly well enough to drop in on him and exchange greetings and whatnot when i bring these papers but today hes sick  maybe he has the flu hes very sick indeed and theres a bed in there  the building may not always have been a government building in the first place but in any case theres a little room that hes in that has a bed in it  theres nothing at all unusual about that because after all sometimes even a government official might need to lie down or he might be sick i pass by that room  i stop and talk to his secretary who will take the papers and see that they get handled and shes just telling me that it would be best not to disturb him right now i go into the hall only a few feet away and sit down in a chair to wait for the papers to get handled  l have left there and i guess ive gone home but wherever ive been informed  i think by telephone  that bob costas has died this is a shock and disappointment to everybody  hes really well liked hes a really nice guy and im thinking particularly of judy early  shes a particular friend of his she and her husband im supposed to see her later myself and she calls me and she doesnt know that i know yet and i can hear the sadness in her voice and she mentions it and i say yes i already know  im terribly sorry so we reschedule our meeting for another time chris is also here  i think he just stopped by for a visit and i tell him that im gonna go out and do something else i think i still have some sort of business to take care of but in any case where i go next is a kind of amusement place what i see is a sort of lobby with a hostesstype person in it and food service drink service and waitresses and whatnot  theyre in sort of little costumes the theme is more or less middle european i dont know what else there is to do but theres this thing thats not exactly a ride its a place where can you walk down on it and be very high up in the air  its a thrill sort of thing i decide im gonna do this  ive got a drink in my hand as well  not supposed to be dangerous of course but its the sort of thing people get nervous about im certainly nervous to some extent  i have a mixture of feelings where im still sad about bob and wanting to be on my own and kind of reflective and at the same time i think it would be helpful to be out on this thing where there could be some other element in my feelings  where i could  a kind of stimulus  a bit of external excitement as i say ive got a drink of some kind  go to the entrance of the thing and meet up with dirk kirk  he works here i dont know in what capacity but i had said i wanted to talk to him and he comes along brenda is somewhere not far behind but dirk comes up  we visit for a bit i am really wanting to carry on an extended conversation but it turns out he cant go out on this thing because hes an employee of course hes got stuff to do  i think his job is as usual some sort of lessthanthrilling lessthanimpressive job but he certainly wants to keep it and there are people who will notice if hes not doing what hes supposed to be doing hes kind of tentative about spending so much time talking to me already we exchange a few bits of information  i tell him about bob and he tells me how things are going with him  brenda and of course tries to make things very upandup very cheerful  brenda comes along with a friend of hers and sorta waits  doesnt say much  an air of vague disapproval  nothing too exotic i go ahead take my leave of them and go on out to this thing you sort of step onto this thing very much like a terrace that goes down gradually  theres a bit of walkway with a wood railing  you can sit on builtin benches  and the thing is as you walk along the thing shakes it feels rickety indeed now everything else that you can see is quite stable the building its attached to is quite stable  and the ground is not several stories down as you imagine theres actually a floor not too far below you so it seems as if you fell it wouldnt be too drastic but at the same time the thing continues to go down so what i assume is that the whole structure is going down  im assuming that now but i didnt in the dream  i didnt know what to expect in the dream but the place youre standing on if youre moving is going to shake with you if you sit down its stable again and thats why i do it like i said im wanting to reflect and im quite willing to just move out here and sit down for a bit drink my drink and muse upon things  about the sadness and how people come and go and how your friends can be sad and you can sympathize with em and thats all i do for a

the place i am is either the library or a school or both  i both work here and am taking a class here  im supposed to turn in a report of some kind but i havent done the work yet  i havent had time i need a piece of information about how long was the average hospital stay of wounded soldiers in wwi  and i havent found it yet im in a room where im meant to be working and not looking at books but  as you know  if i see one i want to flip through it see what it is the book ive been looking at is open on the table  its rather kidoriented lots of pictures and brokenup page formats i look over the pages but i still dont see what i want theres a lot of other books on this table most of them old looking like rebinds i think theyre all kids books im looking at the titles and find one that strikes me fancy so i set it aside to look at later im not sure if its that book or another but i am looking at one more closely  it has to do with how to live with your family in various situations  humorous style like so many kids books are in order to help get the point across im a bit frustrated knowing i dont have time to get everything done and id rather just read for enjoyment i realize ill just have to be late with the report it wont get done in time oh i guess i could do the rest of the report without that information but i want to get it all in having once thought of it the old doubts creep in  am i indulging myself in perfectionism or whatever it is do i have to do it thoroughly or not at all is it not all right not to do well or is this information really necessary and if i just applied myself wouldnt i get it right have i been lazy nuts anyway something different distracts me lisas kite has gotten repaired and were going to fly it its a standard kiteshape and blue  dont know what was wrong with it but it was taken away for repair before we ever got it up and now this is a big event im turning around and seeing that there are other people here a fair number weve gone into another room this school is built like a stone park pavilion its a long open place with walls in between rooms but a walkway all along one  side this one end is a kind of theaterroom it has a puppet stage and a couple of openings underneath it that lead backstage theyre curtained one red one blue plain cotton and an adult could get through them by getting on hands and knees the people with me it seems like theyve come to observe or inspect something  were facing the stageend of the room without stagesets or anything you can see through to the outside the rest of the room is empty except maybe for some props theres a woman here who looks something like eleanor parker  business suit aloof short hair slightly disapproving a taskmaster there are a few people behind the stage so the business of the kite comes up people are gathering to see it go and im wondering where lisa is wont she want to be here i see becky come up didnt she get lisa someone to relieve her beckys looking very ritzy herself  hair in a classy knot on the back of her head i go down the passage to see if i see lisa  shes at the other end for some reason i dont want becky to know what im doing so i keep an eye out and just casually step inside the room sideways rather than walking straight in theres a lot of people in here  they seem to be at long benches crosswise in the room  i think theyre all adults  its not a class exactly but more organized than a library lisa is up at the front helping people  and i wave to her mouthing the word kite and pointing she sees and gestures a response  i guess shell be coming when she can i go back down to where well be flying the kite theres a nice lot of people gathered were staying back under the roof of the building mostly and looking out to where theyve got the kite its a bare place with some dunes little hills tufts of grass on theres maybe  or  guys out there with the kite very gungho i notice becky has her hair down now i go back to an opening in a wall sortofplace where theres a bit of fence closing off the pavilion opening and theres some bushes and other plants i duck under and go up to the fence theres another couple of people there friends  one of them is a goodlooking young man whos somebodys husband and one of those people i privately daydream about hes perched on a ledge and i go past him to my own position lisa still hasnt made it yet but they seem to be determined to carry on anyway the sky is clouding over fast  its getting darker by the minute and frankly even if it doesnt rain we wont even be able to see the kite if it gets up but theyre going on anyway they start to run with it and bustle around but cant get it up then i see a light hear a click dont know what it is at first  then i see whats happening since there isnt enough wind theyre lighting a lighter underneath the kite to try to make hot air to lift it this is stupid of course but i cant see any way of stopping them what im afraid of is theyll set fire to the kite i remark as much to my friends they dont stop of course and the sky gets blacker and stormier and they disappear behind a dune on the left and theres a pfft sound that i recognize its the kite going up of course and thats all she wrote there wont be anything left to save  that kind of flimsy paper just goes all at once what a drag after all that work damn and lisa still isnt here doesnt have any idea what happened blah so we all start away from where were watching and wander on back to

im married to somebody living in a house with kids   fairly ordinary small house forties fifties maybe not in great repair i think theres maybe one of the kids home otherwise just me right now im straightening some things up ive got some old junk out to clean up or throw out and its cold in here so i go look at the thermostat its on the wall next to a table like mine really is and its coming apart its not even easy to read  parts of it are hanging down i fiddle with it some and think maybe its gone for good i think i can read the temperature on it and its set okay but is it really working im not sure i can read what it really is while im over there i knock a box of hair combs off the table onto the floor and one of them breaks i see it between the table and the wall and the ornaments came off and are lying face down  one of them as i pick it up looks like a dead spider and i drop it then i reach for another bit thats definitely a feather and i realize that it was only a butterfly made of feathers so i pick that up and the comb and the rest of em  theyre all that plastic tortoiseshell stuff im also taking some old bits of things with gunk all over them out of a box to unmuck and these things ive got now are covered with wax like somebody burned candles in them i can pull it all out at once  turns out theyre some kind of levellers for furniture we can maybe use them ive also got quite a lump of waxgunk here kind of interesting while im near it i see a shape scurrying along the wall i just know its a rat or something equally nasty i throw the lump of gunk at it  and i may have hit it but didnt do it any damage  it scurries further to an open door that leads into the attic so thats where it came from its gone out of sight but reappears with a baby in its mouth now i can see its not a rat but a possum however in the dream it really didnt look like one it looked more like a prairie dog  i just called it a possum not so dangerous but i still dont want it running around my house especially not depositing babies it freezes when it sees me and i clap and shout to scare it it jumps and jostles the opposite door which leads into one of the boys rooms this is no great help but i dont know what else to do right now in fact people are starting to come in now  my husbands home several friends are coming for dinner kids home from school im feeling up now this is fun cares are on the back burner im chatting with a girlfriend in the kitchen  small kitchen small house but were comfortable my husband is nearby telling stories and jokes im feeling very affectionate toward him but we do have our differences hes saying something about me that he thinks is funny about me being incompetent or something and i think its not only untrue but offensive i look over to him and say im what and he looks like hehheh isnt she cute i go over and face him and he says i was only making a joke and i get fed up and decide to leave im tired of this kind of thing it happens too much and im just not going to stand for it maybe ill leave for good  right now i just believe ill go out and have a good time  find a friend have a drink do my own thing by coincidence a woman i know is just passing and i hitch a ride with her shes on her way somewhere but doesnt mind dropping me off  maybe barbara will be home and ill stay there or linda while were driving along we chat and im still trying hard to remember the name of the blonde actress who used to do everything on tv in the s i keep coming up with madelyn rhue but thats wrong and another name but the right one wont come we drive around a building that has a few shops in it on the street the corner one has a stucco front and a window above the main window and the door and theres what i take to be a plaster ornament above the main window its a cat a purple and white one  not dark purple or quite lavender but noticeable when you look only its stuck on sideways as if the wall was the cats floor however now i can see the cat is real a live breathing cat sitting casually on the wall like nothing was unusual it moves it licks its paw just like normal i strain out the car to peer at it and call to my friend youve got to see this so she looks and we dont know what to make of it and we go on we come to a sort of tiny sadlooking laundromat next to a matching sortof  and stop next to an open vehicle with two men in it one of them gets out and as he passes my side he casually reaches in and lifts out a little round purse by its shoulder strap which has been lying on the dashboard and its easily reached by the very front of the window because the windows been broken out im startled and i say wait that purse put that back  and my friend says what and i ask her if that isnt her purse  and tell her what he did hes gone on into the laundromat and i get out and start after him and point at the car and say something to the other man  and he starts to back the car out while the first one runs out and down the street im verbally calling out descriptions of them and the car  its a lot like a vw thing or some form of jeep but i cant see what for all the numbers painted on the back im not even sure i can remember the license  for all the other stuff i run behind and grab onto the back to get a closer look then jump off we go into the  thing where theyve seen all this and were going to call the police but suddenly the first guy   comes bursting into the place and now hes got a gun a revolver im pretty shaken but i get down behind a table and pull it up in front of me he definitely wants to shoot me thats what hes come back for hes real mad i say do you really mean to kill me just for a little purse that probably didnt have anything in it anyway im getting a real sober feeling that im about to get actually shot maybe killed and i sure dont like it but im determined not to panic id rather get shot deliberately knowing whats happening than to panic and be desperately scared

guess and other sons  daughters they were just in the vicinity and are going to give the wife et al a lift home i seem to be excluded which i think is pretty tacky they walk along to where the car is and after a hesitation i tag along trying to chat with the younger son whos somewhat retarded and who i have previously had a sort of amiable relationship with hes dressed up in a suit rather unusual and hes not interested in talking to me  in fact we stop for a bit and as were facing each other i can see hes looking at me with real hostility very strange im disconcerted and figure i better just go on off my merry way elsewhere on the street further up im walking along with my purse firmly clamped under my arm  i feel a tug on it and turn around to see whats going on a sleazylooking little man in an illfitting suit has hold of it  he thought he could just snatch it apparently and since i have it firmly he didnt get it he looks at me menacingly as if id better let go of the thing or id be sorry and i pull back on it again very indignant neither of us makes a sound im not anxious to cause a scene if hell just let go maybe hell think twice about pursesnatching again he apparently just wants me to be intimidated into letting him have it because he could hurt me  indeed he starts to reach into his jacket for something making an expression thats supposed to be warning me  i guess hes got a gun or a knife but im not going for it not yet anyway theres lots of people around he could hardly get away with it  though at the same time i realize he probably could the way things are today im worried about that sort of thing still i yank on my purse before he can reach whatever it is and get it free i hustle on ahead it goes through my mind that i ought to hold my purse further forward to make it harder for somebody to grab from behind then i picture myself always carrying my purse  clutched tightly to my chest like im paranoid then i picture everybody all the people going up and down the street carrying their stuff like that all holding on for dear life ludicrous really oh well i stop to tell a policeman whos standing a bit further up the street what happened but hes not interested i go on to this hotelapartment house that im  in it looks like a lot of places ive seen in england  long hallways oldlooking but solid very well kept plain dark wood stairrails etc this man runs it he has a bit of jerry haynes and walter pidgeon in him and were trying to hide elvis presley im a sort of companion although there are some others involved in this effort and weve come to this

comfortable with him i meet them in our room and put my things down coat over the back of the couch etc and we go down the hall a few yards up a few steps and around a corner to another room the man leaves were to wait i think about my purse again after a few minutes realizing its just sitting on the back of the couch very noticeable and we didnt shut the door  theres nobody about the place might be deserted except for us but im worried i know i shouldnt leave elvis alone but i get antsy and after a few more minutes i decide itll be okay to just dash back to the room and fix it i look all down the hall  theres nobody to be seen no sounds  and i go my purse is there but as i pick it up it seems to feel different lighter like somethings missing i check briefly but it seems okay  checkbooks there that would be the biggest thing dont know maybe its lighter because i had something in it earlier that usually isnt oh well i take it back with me to the other room elvis isnt there uhoh i look all over for him  this is a kind of suite it has a kitchen and living area  an efficiency apartment no elvis the man comes back some other people too one of whom is a girlfriend of mine we discuss the matter and divide up somebody goes out the man gets on the phone its also getting on for dinnertime and were cooking something i figure we want some cinnamon for this dish weve got going and i think of a plant thats in the back of the room near the window it has little leaves on it that either are cinnamon or taste like it and i start to pick some off i look out the window casually and am surprised to see a dog lying on the grass whats in back of this  is mostly trees a little bit of yard and a little railroad track its dark and what light there is is coming from here through the window this dog looks funny and i suddenly see blood on its head and i realize its been hit  it looks dead yuck but as i watch it moves  it was just hurt it lifts its head up and shifts around and i now realize its not even a dog  i guess  maybe it is but its beginning to look like an elephant thats very weird im getting very confused watching it i realize that if its an elephant it must be a baby if i mistook it for a dog geez i suppose id better tell somebody about this but im not sure im not hallucinating either wow i go back into the room and mean to give the leaves to my friend for the pot but before i do she shows me she found some old cinnamon somewhere and shes all ready to use that i dont mention my leaves though i feel rather shot down  its amazing how little i feel as if i were a little kid whod been slighted by her parents so i just poopoo myself and carry on we go into the dining room this place has gotten bigger you see and were talking theres a dining table lengthwise in the room a window at the end with filmy drapes and just the daylight through them so the rooms in shadow theres a chair or two away from the table standing between us having just come in the door and the space next to the table on the other side  is a very large papiermache black bird i dont know what its for  though maybe its something to do with an upcoming party the mans having  but i look at it briefly its rather neat it moves and at first im surprised but realize its probably just tipped over vibrated off balance but then it moves again and im sure its done it on purpose i say stop that as if its alive thinking how silly i sound and remark to my girlfriend that im sure i saw it move i go around the chair to get in front of it as its moved toward the table and i squat down facing it when i do i realize its actually a cat not a bird how could i have mistaken it for a bird strange and its very cunning this thing it doesnt quite look like papiermache any more its got fur  and i notice two extra eyes looking at me hidden in the black fur above the fake eyes i stare for a minute then realize what im seeing  by george its elvis this is a disguise i tell my girlfriend to come see and at first she doesnt either  this is really good i explain to her what this is and first she says oh pshaw something like that but then she sees too and is also dumbfounded there are two blue eyes peeping through that fur i dont know how he got in this outfit that fast but it sure is a good way to hide i suspect that the man has something to do with this but i dont know,nightmare,nightmare,0,-5.4239435,41.22121,0.006661643,0.014761839,0.971907212,0.006669307

the place i am is either the library or a school or both  i both work here and am taking a class here  im supposed to turn in a report of some kind but i havent done the work yet  i havent had time i need a piece of information about how long was the average hospital stay of wounded soldiers in wwi  and i havent found it yet im in a room where im meant to be working and not looking at books but  as you know  if i see one i want to flip through it see what it is the book ive been looking at is open on the table  its rather kidoriented lots of pictures and brokenup page formats i look over the pages but i still dont see what i want theres a lot of other books on this table most of them old looking like rebinds i think theyre all kids books im looking at the titles and find one that strikes me fancy so i set it aside to look at later im not sure if its that book or another but i am looking at one more closely  it has to do with how to live with your family in various situations  humorous style like so many kids books are in order to help get the point across im a bit frustrated knowing i dont have time to get everything done and id rather just read for enjoyment i realize ill just have to be late with the report it wont get done in time oh i guess i could do the rest of the report without that information but i want to get it all in having once thought of it the old doubts creep in  am i indulging myself in perfectionism or whatever it is do i have to do it thoroughly or not at all is it not all right not to do well or is this information really necessary and if i just applied myself wouldnt i get it right have i been lazy nuts anyway something different distracts me lisas kite has gotten repaired and were going to fly it its a standard kiteshape and blue  dont know what was wrong with it but it was taken away for repair before we ever got it up and now this is a big event im turning around and seeing that there are other people here a fair number weve gone into another room this school is built like a stone park pavilion its a long open place with walls in between rooms but a walkway all along one  side this one end is a kind of theaterroom it has a puppet stage and a couple of openings underneath it that lead backstage theyre curtained one red one blue plain cotton and an adult could get through them by getting on hands and knees the people with me it seems like theyve come to observe or inspect something  were facing the stageend of the room without stagesets or anything you can see through to the outside the rest of the room is empty except maybe for some props theres a woman here who looks something like eleanor parker  business suit aloof short hair slightly disapproving a taskmaster there are a few people behind the stage so the business of the kite comes up people are gathering to see it go and im wondering where lisa is wont she want to be here i see becky come up didnt she get lisa someone to relieve her beckys looking very ritzy herself  hair in a classy knot on the back of her head i go down the passage to see if i see lisa  shes at the other end for some reason i dont want becky to know what im doing so i keep an eye out and just casually step inside the room sideways rather than walking straight in theres a lot of people in here  they seem to be at long benches crosswise in the room  i think theyre all adults  its not a class exactly but more organized than a library lisa is up at the front helping people  and i wave to her mouthing the word kite and pointing she sees and gestures a response  i guess shell be coming when she can i go back down to where well be flying the kite theres a nice lot of people gathered were staying back under the roof of the building mostly and looking out to where theyve got the kite its a bare place with some dunes little hills tufts of grass on theres maybe  or  guys out there with the kite very gungho i notice becky has her hair down now i go back to an opening in a wall sortofplace where theres a bit of fence closing off the pavilion opening and theres some bushes and other plants i duck under and go up to the fence theres another couple of people there friends  one of them is a goodlooking young man whos somebodys husband and one of those people i privately daydream about hes perched on a ledge and i go past him to my own position lisa still hasnt made it yet but they seem to be determined to carry on anyway the sky is clouding over fast  its getting darker by the minute and frankly even if it doesnt rain we wont even be able to see the kite if it gets up but theyre going on anyway they start to run with it and bustle around but cant get it up then i see a light hear a click dont know what it is at first  then i see whats happening since there isnt enough wind theyre lighting a lighter underneath the kite to try to make hot air to lift it this is stupid of course but i cant see any way of stopping them what im afraid of is theyll set fire to the kite i remark as much to my friends they dont stop of course and the sky gets blacker and stormier and they disappear behind a dune on the left and theres a pfft sound that i recognize its the kite going up of course and thats all she wrote there wont be anything left to save  that kind of flimsy paper just goes all at once what a drag after all that work damn and lisa still isnt here doesnt have any idea what happened blah so we all start away from where were watching and wander on back to

im married to somebody living in a house with kids   fairly ordinary small house forties fifties maybe not in great repair i think theres maybe one of the kids home otherwise just me right now im straightening some things up ive got some old junk out to clean up or throw out and its cold in here so i go look at the thermostat its on the wall next to a table like mine really is and its coming apart its not even easy to read  parts of it are hanging down i fiddle with it some and think maybe its gone for good i think i can read the temperature on it and its set okay but is it really working im not sure i can read what it really is while im over there i knock a box of hair combs off the table onto the floor and one of them breaks i see it between the table and the wall and the ornaments came off and are lying face down  one of them as i pick it up looks like a dead spider and i drop it then i reach for another bit thats definitely a feather and i realize that it was only a butterfly made of feathers so i pick that up and the comb and the rest of em  theyre all that plastic tortoiseshell stuff im also taking some old bits of things with gunk all over them out of a box to unmuck and these things ive got now are covered with wax like somebody burned candles in them i can pull it all out at once  turns out theyre some kind of levellers for furniture we can maybe use them ive also got quite a lump of waxgunk here kind of interesting while im near it i see a shape scurrying along the wall i just know its a rat or something equally nasty i throw the lump of gunk at it  and i may have hit it but didnt do it any damage  it scurries further to an open door that leads into the attic so thats where it came from its gone out of sight but reappears with a baby in its mouth now i can see its not a rat but a possum however in the dream it really didnt look like one it looked more like a prairie dog  i just called it a possum not so dangerous but i still dont want it running around my house especially not depositing babies it freezes when it sees me and i clap and shout to scare it it jumps and jostles the opposite door which leads into one of the boys rooms this is no great help but i dont know what else to do right now in fact people are starting to come in now  my husbands home several friends are coming for dinner kids home from school im feeling up now this is fun cares are on the back burner im chatting with a girlfriend in the kitchen  small kitchen small house but were comfortable my husband is nearby telling stories and jokes im feeling very affectionate toward him but we do have our differences hes saying something about me that he thinks is funny about me being incompetent or something and i think its not only untrue but offensive i look over to him and say im what and he looks like hehheh isnt she cute i go over and face him and he says i was only making a joke and i get fed up and decide to leave im tired of this kind of thing it happens too much and im just not going to stand for it maybe ill leave for good  right now i just believe ill go out and have a good time  find a friend have a drink do my own thing by coincidence a woman i know is just passing and i hitch a ride with her shes on her way somewhere but doesnt mind dropping me off  maybe barbara will be home and ill stay there or linda while were driving along we chat and im still trying hard to remember the name of the blonde actress who used to do everything on tv in the s i keep coming up with madelyn rhue but thats wrong and another name but the right one wont come we drive around a building that has a few shops in it on the street the corner one has a stucco front and a window above the main window and the door and theres what i take to be a plaster ornament above the main window its a cat a purple and white one  not dark purple or quite lavender but noticeable when you look only its stuck on sideways as if the wall was the cats floor however now i can see the cat is real a live breathing cat sitting casually on the wall like nothing was unusual it moves it licks its paw just like normal i strain out the car to peer at it and call to my friend youve got to see this so she looks and we dont know what to make of it and we go on we come to a sort of tiny sadlooking laundromat next to a matching sortof  and stop next to an open vehicle with two men in it one of them gets out and as he passes my side he casually reaches in and lifts out a little round purse by its shoulder strap which has been lying on the dashboard and its easily reached by the very front of the window because the windows been broken out im startled and i say wait that purse put that back  and my friend says what and i ask her if that isnt her purse  and tell her what he did hes gone on into the laundromat and i get out and start after him and point at the car and say something to the other man  and he starts to back the car out while the first one runs out and down the street im verbally calling out descriptions of them and the car  its a lot like a vw thing or some form of jeep but i cant see what for all the numbers painted on the back im not even sure i can remember the license  for all the other stuff i run behind and grab onto the back to get a closer look then jump off we go into the  thing where theyve seen all this and were going to call the police but suddenly the first guy   comes bursting into the place and now hes got a gun a revolver im pretty shaken but i get down behind a table and pull it up in front of me he definitely wants to shoot me thats what hes come back for hes real mad i say do you really mean to kill me just for a little purse that probably didnt have anything in it anyway im getting a real sober feeling that im about to get actually shot maybe killed and i sure dont like it but im determined not to panic id rather get shot deliberately knowing whats happening than to panic and be desperately scared

im coming up to a sort of rocky ledge with a low  wall  all around theres sky huge and beautiful theres a mountain range in the distance the colors are all yellowish and theres a sort of earlymorning feel its not warm but its not real cold either somehow i know this either is tibet or were coming to it down beneath the wall are a couple of flowers growing theyre very sturdy thickleafed the kind of petals that start out green first and shaped something like hyacinths i think ill eat one but i see it isnt fully developed yet theres another though with a wider shape to it and quite thick  rather than made up of lightweight petals and i pull that and take bites of it as i do  i find that buried in it is a small saucerlike bit of pottery standard whiteglazed with a flower pattern round the edge much like diner dishes  i pull it out and see that its the foot of a sort of vase or stemmed dish wed found around here shortly before and wed wondered where the foot was it seems that the flower just grew around it we go on soon we get to civilization of a sort were in a stairwell of a building i can tell is massive and the scene is mostly dark as if it were night and we were seeing outside through windows but were not  on the left  is a huge wall and it shows a magnificent scene although right now i cant remember what of or even what it looked like  it may have even been an outdoor landscape as if there were a window there i halfway think the wall in front on the stairwell was indeed a window but im not sure to the right is an open door into a lighted room and people  not in large numbers  keep moving up and down the stairs and into and out of the room theyre all orientals these people dressed in native clothes the long coats the hats with round standup brims the slipper shoes im aware that this place is equivalent in some respects to a shopping mall  of course plain and simple it is one it has lots of vendors selling things that people want and need all under one roof but theres some fundamental difference in it too these people are taking the thing more seriously for one thing and it isnt set up intentionally for fun  though there are some neat things about it the lefthand wall for instance at first i thought i was looking at  really magnificent and elaborate but now something has shifted  either its done this on purpose or my viewpoint has changed but i see now that the whole thing is painted an illusion a bloody good illusion but nevertheless not what i thought it was now that i know that it bothers me  the whole situation bothers me im not sure what to do next at the same time whats occupying my mind is the observation of this shoppingmall business the idea of the mall is sort of new to us here but when you think about it theres nothing unusual about it except that we started building malls in places where there were already plenty of stores to be found elsewhere stores are still grouped collectively for the convenience of the shoppers but they have to come from farther away and do more business at a time thats why there were fairs and street markets it wouldnt be any sillier to build a regular mall in tibet than in texas for heavens sake if people want to buy things why wouldnt they do it in a mall just as easily as from rickety booths on the street im on a city bus with several people from yoga class  i guess weve just left a class  including george and maybe cynthia ive got my purse and something else with me which i stow on the seat this is another funny bus  has its seats placed differently from regular buses and its up high like the outoftowncoaches were all in a pretty fun mood and we bowl along through a pretty part of town with big trees and nice streets older houses and occasional stores and offices at one point the bus is diverted by road works from its regular route and we turn to the left then because of the diversion we have to drive through a building  actually its a lot like the central area pharmacy except its got a garage attached theres  sections to it you can pull in the front or the back  the front is a bit more finished with matching red brick to the store  you can enter the store from there the back is different with painted walls a little more garagelike the bus stops in the front its going to wait there to catch up to its schedule and we all pile out of it to stretch our legs and look around this is a place we know anyway but its neat theres a sort of art exhibit in the back section various things stuck up on the wall as if a childrens school class had done them sue s is here  and shes looking at them with us and tree is here too  this place is only a short distance from where i live  on the street in back matter of fact  and hes been exploring down here i guess hes come in the back door  and i pick him up and show him to the people actually im surprised hes letting me do that and im keeping a good strong grip because hes beginning to get twitchy  but sue and some others say oh what a pretty kitty and i make up my mind to just go on home with him from here since were so close without waiting for the bus i have to go back in to get my stuff though and i suppose i put tree down because he wasnt with me for the next part i climb up and go to get my purse and things but while im here the bus starts to move i guess it must have been left in gear or something because it starts going right on out and across the street  and carries on for a couple of blocks it stops eventually because it runs up against something i guess but its a bit precarious i can see that the street is going a bit downhill and if it starts to roll again itll be hard to stop i get out very carefully and go around to the front thinking i might push it backward off of the incline if i can  but its just barely starting to move again and i give it a push but no go  oh dear i leap out of the way and remember i still havent got my things so i jump back on the bus gathers momentum and rolls onward down a street and around a curve and finally comes to rest somewhere no particular damage done i am joined now by a little guy in a rather exotic outfit  hes not quite midgetsized but definitely well below average   we discuss the situation which is more involved than it looks  we need to contact somebody for help we cant handle this bus on our own  we know theres normally a crew of  men to run it and we cant just leave it where it is and go  we poke around some and find the radio to call the centralwhatever with and send a message to send help that done we banter around some more  this all seems like a rather fun adventure  and sort of get cozy he proposes having sex right there in the cabin and i think it sounds like something of a lark and say yes  ive never had sex with an elf before for sure and it might be very different who knows weve got nothing better to do till the rescue party gets here although we dont know when thatll be actually a fair amount of time has passed already suddenly as he moves over me lying on the floor he gets bigger  much bigger he sort of stretches out till he looms over me and i dont like it i say so and next he reaches beyond me over my head to a shelf where hes put something to be handy its a kind of facemask only its made of beads  and it fits over his chin loosely like a beard the look on his face has gone very serious the way you do when the playful part of sex gives way to the other feelings at that moment the crew sent out from the central office arrives we break apart in a hurry as you might imagine and explain who we are and what happened there are  men and a woman they look very cold and matteroffact but ask us to help  i go downstairs  toward the front of the place were in  you might call it a cockpit  it no longer looks like a bus theres a wall behind very shiplike  there are stairs or a ladder to the next level i hadnt even realized this was here theres a bathroom down here good i need one and go across the room towards it but a man goes into it before me so i have to wait now im confused who is this guy and how did he get here before me is he one of the tree that just arrived and got here by another stair or has he been down here the whole time if so why didnt he say anything is he hiding oh well ill just

im downtown waiting for a bus and i see my neighbors  theyre mexicans actually a large family heres the mother and a couple of daughters we chat and some others in the family come along husband i guess and other sons  daughters they were just in the vicinity and are going to give the wife et al a lift home i seem to be excluded which i think is pretty tacky they walk along to where the car is and after a hesitation i tag along trying to chat with the younger son whos somewhat retarded and who i have previously had a sort of amiable relationship with hes dressed up in a suit rather unusual and hes not interested in talking to me  in fact we stop for a bit and as were facing each other i can see hes looking at me with real hostility very strange im disconcerted and figure i better just go on off my merry way elsewhere on the street further up im walking along with my purse firmly clamped under my arm  i feel a tug on it and turn around to see whats going on a sleazylooking little man in an illfitting suit has hold of it  he thought he could just snatch it apparently and since i have it firmly he didnt get it he looks at me menacingly as if id better let go of the thing or id be sorry and i pull back on it again very indignant neither of us makes a sound im not anxious to cause a scene if hell just let go maybe hell think twice about pursesnatching again he apparently just wants me to be intimidated into letting him have it because he could hurt me  indeed he starts to reach into his jacket for something making an expression thats supposed to be warning me  i guess hes got a gun or a knife but im not going for it not yet anyway theres lots of people around he could hardly get away with it  though at the same time i realize he probably could the way things are today im worried about that sort of thing still i yank on my purse before he can reach whatever it is and get it free i hustle on ahead it goes through my mind that i ought to hold my purse further forward to make it harder for somebody to grab from behind then i picture myself always carrying my purse  clutched tightly to my chest like im paranoid then i picture everybody all the people going up and down the street carrying their stuff like that all holding on for dear life ludicrous really oh well i stop to tell a policeman whos standing a bit further up the street what happened but hes not interested i go on to this hotelapartment house that im  in it looks like a lot of places ive seen in england  long hallways oldlooking but solid very well kept plain dark wood stairrails etc this man runs it he has a bit of jerry haynes and walter pidgeon in him and were trying to hide elvis presley im a sort of companion although there are some others involved in this effort and weve come to this man as a contact who will help hide elvis and get him away the man is rather on the suspicious side himself though  rather odd a dapper little guy with a silly little mustache cryptic secretive im not comfortable with him i meet them in our room and put my things down coat over the back of the couch etc and we go down the hall a few yards up a few steps and around a corner to another room the man leaves were to wait i think about my purse again after a few minutes realizing its just sitting on the back of the couch very noticeable and we didnt shut the door  theres nobody about the place might be deserted except for us but im worried i know i shouldnt leave elvis alone but i get antsy and after a few more minutes i decide itll be okay to just dash back to the room and fix it i look all down the hall  theres nobody to be seen no sounds  and i go my purse is there but as i pick it up it seems to feel different lighter like somethings missing i check briefly but it seems okay  checkbooks there that would be the biggest thing dont know maybe its lighter because i had something in it earlier that usually isnt oh well i take it back with me to the other room elvis isnt there uhoh i look all over for him  this is a kind of suite it has a kitchen and living area  an efficiency apartment no elvis the man comes back some other people too one of whom is a girlfriend of mine we discuss the matter and divide up somebody goes out the man gets on the phone its also getting on for dinnertime and were cooking something i figure we want some cinnamon for this dish weve got going and i think of a plant thats in the back of the room near the window it has little leaves on it that either are cinnamon or taste like it and i start to pick some off i look out the window casually and am surprised to see a dog lying on the grass whats in back of this  is mostly trees a little bit of yard and a little railroad track its dark and what light there is is coming from here through the window this dog looks funny and i suddenly see blood on its head and i realize its been hit  it looks dead yuck but as i watch it moves  it was just hurt it lifts its head up and shifts around and i now realize its not even a dog  i guess  maybe it is but its beginning to look like an elephant thats very weird im getting very confused watching it i realize that if its an elephant it must be a baby if i mistook it for a dog geez i suppose id better tell somebody about this but im not sure im not hallucinating either wow i go back into the room and mean to give the leaves to my friend for the pot but before i do she shows me she found some old cinnamon somewhere and shes all ready to use that i dont mention my leaves though i feel rather shot down  its amazing how little i feel as if i were a little kid whod been slighted by her parents so i just poopoo myself and carry on we go into the dining room this place has gotten bigger you see and were talking theres a dining table lengthwise in the room a window at the end with filmy drapes and just the daylight through them so the rooms in shadow theres a chair or two away from the table standing between us having just come in the door and the space next to the table on the other side  is a very large papiermache black bird i dont know what its for  though maybe its something to do with an upcoming party the mans having  but i look at it briefly its rather neat it moves and at first im surprised but realize its probably just tipped over vibrated off balance but then it moves again and im sure its done it on purpose i say stop that as if its alive thinking how silly i sound and remark to my girlfriend that im sure i saw it move i go around the chair to get in front of it as its moved toward the table and i squat down facing it when i do i realize its actually a cat not a bird how could i have mistaken it for a bird strange and its very cunning this thing it doesnt quite look like papiermache any more its got fur  and i notice two extra eyes looking at me hidden in the black fur above the fake eyes i stare for a minute then realize what im seeing  by george its elvis this is a disguise i tell my girlfriend to come see and at first she doesnt either  this is really good i explain to her what this is and first she says oh pshaw something like that but then she sees too and is also dumbfounded there are two blue eyes peeping through that fur i dont know how he got in this outfit that fast but it sure is a good way to hide i suspect that the man has something to do with this but i dont know,nightmare,nightmare,0,-5.4239516,41.221214,0.006661643,0.014761839,0.971907212,0.006669307

im with some other people  friends im not sure who but they were like mt maybe even my brother and even don and lauren or somebody and we were going to look at a house this house was on a residential street that had some very nice large houses on it we were looking for a house that we might want to rent and we first went past it to the end of the street and we looked at the numbers and went back to it the houses at the end of the street were extremely nice and looked very expensive indeed and when we backed up a bit to go back to the house we wanted it seemed to be at least something less formal and maybe more likely but still an awfully nice house we were surprised that the person we were thinking of renting it from lived there because it was somebody more or less our age like us that wouldnt necessarily be able to afford a big house like that so we went up to the door and knocked and looked at the outside the person that answered was female and she let us in and said shed show us around nice and friendly and what we saw on the inside is not at all what we expected there was this enormous room broken up into areas and it had another level to it as though it were a sunken living room it was very open  there wasnt a whole lot of furniture there were people around and it looked very reminiscent of a hippie pad from the early s or s or more like a commune where a lot of people were living in the same place and just sort of having a good time and not just being roommates or residents or something like that and there seemed to be people having a good time around the girl that was with us just took us on through into the livingroom sort of area and straight across to a door that led into a small sort of shed really that youre meant to go through and you go outside from before we got there i was looking outside through a plate glass window on the right and saw a kind of little patio or garden sort of thing it wasnt real small it had bushes and stuff in it and there was a cat or two sitting out there something happened about the cat but i dont quite remember  it was large and black  and it kinda did something and left then we went into the shed and i was bringing up the rear everybody went back out again but i was interested in something that was hanging in the shed it was kind of like a potting shed although they had been stuck  certain things as well as plants  it was maybe kind of a greenhouse i guess or something in between i took whatever it was off the wall and went outside with it to have a better look at it it seems to me that it was like terracotta and i dont remember what it was after id looked at it and nobody else was  i took it back in and hung it back up on the wall again next i am on trial for something that i do not know exactly but it surely would have had to do with something like embezzlement what they were questioning was how i had so much money to spend why i had such nice things there were a whole lot of people there it was more like an auditorium than a courtroom  there were people up on the sides like bleachers or something and the light in the courtroom was very bright the prosecutor was very strong and powerful he wasnt entirely angry  of course he wasnt supposed to be angry but he was real determined that i should be  examined as thoroughly as possible in case i had done this  he would ask how i could afford to buy  like clothes or something how i could afford to have such nice things on my salary during the course of this trial they had called for a physical examination of me like an operation even  they wanted to make cuts in my body to examine something  not going all the way inside to the organs and so forth but kinda superficial cuts where you cut the skin in long straight lines down the arms and down the torso maybe something to do with bacteria or something i dont know i was real concerned about that but i was not real concerned about the trial in general there was a place in the back of the courtroom  it was rather more like a dressing room and i had of course my lawyer and some other people helping me out  i guess they would be like people on my lawyers staff or something  an older woman blonde professionaltype woman my lawyer was a man in a suit you know your basic sort of lawyer certainly not a kid but your basic yuppie professional and they were like attending on me like i was  oh dear somebody like a tv star or something  i would be in the back getting dressed getting my hair done stuff like that it wasnt very luxurious but it was certainly not what you would expect of being in a courtroom in fact i wasnt even in the courtroom  i wasnt even paying attention to how the trial was going except for the sound of the prosecutors voice he was quite loud and determined  making a show for the audience  and most of em were my friends and they didnt want to see me get into trouble they were interested certainly but he was definitely going to have to prove what he alleged and all of these questions seemed to me to be real obviously geared to getting me into trouble because everything he was asking could be answered very simply and he wasnt listening to what  well it wasnt that he wasnt listening to what i had to say because i wasnt there for him to hear but i was the one who could clear it up in the first place and until he got me on the stand where i could tell him these things it seemed like there wasnt much point in him even asking nobody else could tell him that i wouldnt buy anything very expensive unless it was on sale and i charge things and pay them out and sometimes people take me to lunch or something or i may buy myself meals and not get my hair cut things like that i certainly havent stolen anything and sometimes i do think i spend more than i need to  or well not more than i need to but more than i can afford to but thats my problem its certainly not anybody elses money and i dont know why i should be on trial for it but this physical examination thing concerned me quite a lot theres kind of a conflict here i have the impression that i have already had this examination and it didnt really work the way they thought it was going to but i think that isnt logical because that wouldnt have happened and there wouldnt have been any point in me being concerned about it further but i was  i was concerned about having it done correctly and fascinated with the procedure itself and so there werent actually any cuts on my body its as though they had tried to and it wouldnt do it so i was interested in that and i just decided id do it myself i got something to cut with  you see im not in the courtroom at the moment and whoever has been with me in the dressing room area  what i mean by that by the way is that its back off of the courtroom assuredly but its not closed off from it  theres a place where you can go like to change clothes but its just a back room open to the courtroom all the way in the back where nobody can turn around and look at you or nobodys doing it theyre not  or their attention is out in the middle of the court  anyway so whoever has been with me back there has gone away so im alone and i got something like a razor blade and started to make these cuts myself it surely would be awkward if you did that  lying down and trying to even make the sort of cut im talking about with one arm without looking at it but its as though i wasnt doing it that way its as though i was doing it from outside my body and was a little bit ragged and awkward at it at first but eventually i got the hang of it and  this is how it seemed awkward to me as though i was doing it from right over my body and  just like you would a doll you know  straight down and i discovered that it was awkward to do  the righthand side of my body  which seems to be the lefthand side from the position im actually cutting in so what i needed to do is to move around so i moved down to where i was really facing the side of my body to do that this is all very slow and awkward but there wasnt any blood or anything well i did that and i dont know anything more about it  it obviously didnt hurt particularly i know i kept expecting it to  i kept expecting it to feel at least you know like it does when you cut yourself so i was a little bit surprised that it didnt bleed but i wasnt worried about there being any real damage or anything because i knew i would heal up and quite sure that i knew id heal up without scars too just didnt seem that big a deal but now i felt like i had done it for them that they would be happy now it was like i have accomplished whatever it was they wanted me to do for them,nightmare,nightmare,0,-7.3375926,41.097935,0.006611644,0.017981381,0.968336755,0.00707022
